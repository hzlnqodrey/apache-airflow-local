# Cleaning-up the environment
# The docker-compose environment we have prepared is a “quick-start” one. It was not designed to be used in production and it has a number of caveats - one of them being that the best way to recover from any problem is to clean it up and restart from scratch.
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
rm -rf '<DIRECTORY>'

# AFTER CLEAN, RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS
curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.7.2/docker-compose.yaml'

# Cleaning UP
